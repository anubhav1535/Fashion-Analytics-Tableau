# Fashion Analytics- Tableau
I've created a dashboard that delves into the connection between consumer behavior and their purchasing patterns. Utilizing Tableau's data interpreter, I meticulously cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. By exploring the relationship between consumer attributes and their buying habits, the dashboard offers valuable insights into consumer behavior. This allows stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences and make informed decisions to enhance marketing strategies and product offerings.
